description: Profile and optimize application performance
---

Launch a General-Purpose agent to perform comprehensive performance optimization:

**Phase 1: Profiling**
- Profile the results page rendering performance
- Identify slow components and rendering bottlenecks
- Check for memory leaks in animations
- Analyze bundle size and identify large dependencies
- Review network requests and API call patterns

**Phase 2: Analysis**
- Rank issues by impact (high/medium/low)
- Identify quick wins vs complex optimizations
- Check browser compatibility of optimizations

**Phase 3: Recommendations**
Create a performance optimization plan with:
- Specific bottlenecks found
- Recommended fixes with code examples
- Expected performance improvements
- Priority ranking
- Implementation time estimates

Focus areas:
- Blood animation canvas rendering
- SVG ring performance
- Kiosk polling efficiency
- PWA service worker caching
- Bundle size reduction
