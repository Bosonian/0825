---

**Usage**: /add-feature "Add SMS notifications for incoming ambulances"

Execute smart feature development workflow:

**Phase 1: Research** (2 Explore agents in parallel):
1. Find similar features already implemented in the codebase
2. Find all relevant configuration files and constants

**Phase 2: Design**:
- Based on findings, design the feature following existing patterns
- Identify files that need changes
- Create implementation checklist

**Phase 3: Plan Review**:
- Present the implementation plan
- Ask user for confirmation before proceeding

**Phase 4: Implementation** (after user approval):
- Implement the feature following the plan
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Include error handling and logging

**Phase 5: Testing**:
- Create/update tests for the new feature
- Test locally if possible

**Phase 6: Documentation**:
- Update relevant documentation
- Add code comments where needed

**Phase 7: Summary**:
- List all files changed
- Provide testing instructions
- Suggest next steps
